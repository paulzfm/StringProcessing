# String Processing

This project is based on S. Gulwani's paper: [Automating String Processing in Spreadsheets Using Input-Output Examples](http://msr-waypoint.com/en-us/um/people/sumitg/pubs/popl11-synthesis.pdf).

This is a standard `sbt` project.

Run `sbt` on the project root directory. In the `sbt` prompt, type `test` to run the default tests.
